                <h2>5 Steps To Poland</h2>
                <p>
                  If you are thinking of studying in Poland but do not know how to go about that, please check the step-by-step guidelines presented below, which we have prepared with international students in mind. At the same time, please bear in mind that some of the sections are available only after logging in.

                  How to get admitted to a Polish University? It is easy! First of all you need to find out the general entry requirements. Then, once you have picked your course, you need to take into account the individual requirements of the particular school you are applying to. Some of them may ask you for a few additional documents on top of the general requirements.

                  Should you encounter any problems during any of the stages of the admission process, feel free to contact one of the Think Poland agents. We are here to help and guide you to make a right education choice. Think Poland will also help you with the organization of your trip and then offer you a helping hand during your total stay in Poland.

                        Hello to international students in Warsaw! I came to Poland in 2010. I didn't know anyone in the country. On the Think Poland orientation day I met another girl from India and we became friends. It was easier for us to share experiences of living in a new country. Come to Think Poland events and you'll never be lonely!.
