                From the cities full of sightseeing wonders you can take a trip to breathtaking wild primeval forests with unique flora and fauna. In Poland, everybody will find something for themselves. Love windsurfing? Make sure you visit the Hel Peninsula. Are you into climbing? The Swietokrzyskie Mountains are waiting for you.

              <p>
                 Poland is a great country in which to study. Here, you will find a wide selection of courses you can take at low cost. Polish universities are eager to welcome foreign students, while Polish cities not only offer suitable conditions for studying but also boast plenty of attractions.<br><br>

                Polish education has a long and impressive academic tradition with its roots going back as far as the Middle Ages! Jagiellonian University in Kraków was founded in the 14th century and is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Today we are proud to offer education on a par with the European standards.<br><br>

                In almost every big city, there are public and private schools offering third level education. Course availability is rich and the schools are continuously expanding their offerings to suit the market demand. Polish diplomas are recognized in the European Union (EU) and worldwide, and in countries like the USA, Canada and Australia. Studying in Poland gives you a solid education and a better chance to find a good job in the EU and beyond!<br><br>

                The high quality of Polish education can be seen in the fact that many Polish scientists have built international careers. Did you know that the first full face transplant in the USA was done by a team of surgeons lead by a Polish doctor, Maria Siemionow who graduated from Poznan Medical Academy?<br><br>

                If you choose to study in Poland, you can apply for a Polish Government Scholarship. There are also a lot of other ways to lower the cost of your college fees.

              <h2>Work</h2>
              <p>We have some good news for you! When you are studying in Poland, you can work at the same time! Not only will you be able to earn money for your daily expenditures but also you get a chance to get to know new people and learn more about the country. Students can usually find work as foreign language teachers, waiters/waitresses, bartenders, child minders, shop assistants or cleaners. For these occupations you would need a command of basic Polish. Don’t worry if you can’t speak any Polish yet – ABB Group will help you find a foundational Polish course that will increase your chances of finding work. Another option is seasonal work or, as already mentioned, cleaning. In these circumstances, you do not have to speak Polish. If you are looking for a job, check this website!<br><br>

              Being a student, you also have a chance to participate in free or paid work placements. Depending on your study’s specialization the ability to speak Polish may, or may not, be a requirement.<br><br>

              If you are from the EU or Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland, you can make use of EURES services. EURES is the European Jobs Network of public employment services and their partners on the EU labour market. Its purpose is to provide job placement and information on living and working conditions in the EU member states; to support international and cross-border employment mobility.<br><br>
